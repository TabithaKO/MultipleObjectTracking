            <p><strong>Problem Definition</strong></p>
            <p>The task requires our computer vision algorithm to localize and segment the different objects in a frame.
                After getting the coordinates of the various objects we use a Kalman filter to track their motion
                through out the frames.

            <p><strong>Success and Challenges</strong></p>
            <ul>Bats Experiment.</ul>
            <p>We were able to track most of the bats across multiple frames and draw smooth trajectories. A challenge
                that
                appears is when bats fly faster than the 'norm' it becomes difficult to track them.</p>
            <ul>Cells Experiment.</ul>
            <p>When we analyzed the frames without factoring in the process noise covariance matrix we were able to
                track the objects but it was very noisy (As seen in cells video 1). When we included the process noise
                covariance matrix we noticed that fewer objects were tracked across time but the ones that were tracked
                had more consistent trajectories (paths were longer). </p>

        <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-center">
            <p><strong>Method and Implementation</strong></p>
            <ul><strong> Localization and Segmentation</strong> </ul>
            <p>For the bats dataset we used the localization and segmentation provides by the instructors. For the cell
                dataset we converted the grayscale images to binary using thresholding. We did some erosion and dilation
                on the cells to make them more distinct. We run a contouring algorithm and averaged the x and y values
                of each contour to get the x and y coordinates of the cells.</p>
            <hr>

            <ul><strong>New Tracks and Missing Objects.</strong></ul>
            <p>New Tracks: A track is created for every localized object in the first frame. As we move into successive
                frames we'll
                match each the objects from the previous frame if the cost function is below a certain threshold. If
                there are objects in the current frame that are unmatched, we create new kalman filter objects for them
                and add them to our group of objects that we're tracking
                (hoping we'll match them to a corresponding object in the next frame).
            </p>
            <p>Missing objects: If we have an estimate for the position of an object from a previous frame and we cannot
                find the corresponding measurements on the current frame we will maintain the estimate as the
                measurement. We will increase its missing count by 1. If an object is missing for a number of frames
                that exceeds our 'missing' threshold then we declare it missing officially and take it out of our
                objects list.
            </p>

            <ul><strong>Occlusion and Path Crossing</strong> </ul>
            <p>
                When two or more objects cross paths and sometimes occlude each other, the filter maintains an estimate
                of their position based on the previous frames. It would update this estimate based on the object that
                minimizes the cost. However, as the objects continue to move and the objects become more distinct then
                the filter is able to follow the original object like before.
            </p>
            <ul><strong>Spurious Measurements</strong> </ul>
            <p>
                The draw function in our Kalman filter class only draws object tracks that have a history greater than a
                certain threshold. Spurious measurements are in view for a short time (a few frames) and so their
                history would not exceed the threshold and their paths wouldn't get drawn. Additionally, spurious
                measurements would disappear from the field of view long enough for them to go 'missing' and be removed
                from our group tracked object.
            </p>

            <ul><strong>Advantages/Drawbacks of the Kalman Filter</strong> </ul>
            <p>The Kalman Filter works well for the bats because they follow a predictable trajectory. I think getting
                the velocity of the bats would make it even more accurate. In cases where there is occlusion having more
                measurements than just position would help determine the position and calculate the cost for assignment
                purposes.</p>
            <p>I dont think that the cells experiment would benefit from adding velocity because their movement pattern
                is quite erratic.</p>
